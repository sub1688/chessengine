# Walnut

### Linux support. CMake build system.

Walnut is a simple application framework built with Dear ImGui and designed to be used with Vulkan - basically this means you can seemlessly blend real-time Vulkan rendering with a great UI library to build desktop applications. The plan is to expand Walnut to include common utilities to make immediate-mode desktop apps and simple Vulkan applications.

Currently supports Windows, Linux - with macOS support planned.

Added example RayTracing App from [TheCherno/RayTracing](https://github.com/TheCherno/RayTracing)
